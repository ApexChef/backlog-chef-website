# Backlog Chef Pitch Notes

## 1. TITLE
- "Transform meetings into high-quality backlogs"
- AI-powered intelligence for Scrum teams

## 2. PROBLEM - STORY
- **Quote**: "2 hours in refinement, still incomplete PBIs"
- **Stats**: 2-3 hrs avg meeting, 40% PBIs rejected
- Pain: long meetings, not ready, lost context, repeated mistakes

## 3. WHY THIS HAPPENS
- **No Memory** - forget past decisions, start from scratch
- **No Quality Gate** - no DoR check, incomplete slips through
- **No Context** - missing architecture, dependencies, stakeholders
- Result: wasted time, frustrated teams, lower quality

## 4. SOLUTION
- AI transforms transcripts → high-quality PBIs
- Automated extraction, quality scoring, context enrichment
- Smart questions with suggested answers
- Risk detection before sprint planning

## 5. 8-STEP PIPELINE
1. Event Detection (meeting type)
2. Extract PBIs (candidates from transcript)
3. Score Quality (completeness check)
4. Enrich Context (RAG - similar work, docs)
5. Check Risks (dependencies, blockers)
6. Generate Questions (with proposals)
7. Readiness Check (DoR validation)
8. Output (DevOps, Obsidian, Confluence, JSON)

**Powered by**: Claude AI + RAG

## 6. CLI PRODUCT
- `chef process` - run pipeline
- `chef resume` - continue paused
- `chef status` - view all pipelines
- `chef rag index/query` - semantic search
- `chef export` - output to files
- **10 commands total**

## 7. WEB INTERFACE
- PBI Browser (Table, Card, Kanban views)
- Semantic Search (constraints, patterns, similar work)
- Meetings View (transcripts, speakers)
- Built with: Astro + React + TanStack Table

## 8. DIFFERENTIATORS
- **Domain-Specific** - built for Scrum, not generic
- **Quality Built-In** - scoring prevents incomplete PBIs
- **Context-Aware** - RAG finds similar work/decisions
- **Local-First** - your data stays on your machine
- **Integrated** - Fireflies, DevOps, Jira, Confluence
- **Learns** - indexes your docs, gets smarter

## 9. MARKET
- **TAM**: $1.5B Agile tools market
- **Users**: 12M+ Scrum practitioners
- **Adoption**: 71% companies use Agile
- **Segments**: Dev teams (€500-5k), Enterprise (€5-50k), Consulting (€1-10k)

**Key message**: We complete transcription tools, not compete

## 12. TRACTION & ROADMAP
- ✅ MVP Built (10 CLI commands, 8-step pipeline, RAG)
- ✅ Web Interface (PBI browser, search, meetings)
- 🔄 **NOW**: Beta launch, pilot users
- ⏳ Next: Public launch, self-service

**Status**: 50+ docs, 23 PBIs planned, ready for pilots

## 13. GO-TO-MARKET: WHY CRONOS?
**Built-in customer network!**
- Cronos manages multiple software companies
- Each has dev teams running Scrum
- = Immediate pilot customers

**Phase 1**: Internal Pilots
- 2-3 Cronos portfolio companies
